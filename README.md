I am numerically constructing the Titov–Démoulin (TD) magnetic flux rope model, which is a widely used analytical model for representing twisted magnetic structures in solar active regions and serving as an initial condition for MHD simulations. I built the TD geometry by placing two magnetic charges and adding a ring current and line current to create a realistic coronal magnetic field. I then compute the magnetic field by combining contributions from the charges, ring current, and toroidal field, allowing me to study the full 3D magnetic configuration. Using this framework, my aim is to test when the system remains in force-free equilibrium and when it becomes unstable.
